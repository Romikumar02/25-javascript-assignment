    <h2>Words greater than 8 alphabets are highlighted</h2>
    <p id="my-paragraph">The objective is to write a JavaScript program that enables an image to move according to the direction
        specified by the arrow keys. The program must be able to recognize and respond to the input from the arrow
        keys, and accordingly, update the position of the image on the screen. The program should be able to handle
        the movement of the image in all directions, including up, down, left, and right, in a smooth and responsive
        manner. Have a look at the event key codes before starting the project.</p>
